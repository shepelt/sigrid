# Sigrid Improvement Strategy

1. This spec document is applied to operations for improving Sigrid (this project) itself
2. The improvement job should result in a new file and saved to "temp"
3. Sigrid main functionalities are implemented in index.js files located at the root. This document is merely a directive and is read only.
4. This document is used only as the master guide line. To fulfil the user's improvement proposal, come up with a reasonable plan but do not save the plan.
5. Read the content of the original file before creating the modified version to make incremental changes.
6. Keep the modification minimal and concise. Make no changes to comments or variable names.
7. The modified version of the original files should be saved to a temporary file inside "temp" directory, not to the original file, but the modified version should be a copy of the original file (+changes)
8. The goal of improvement job is to result in a new source code file.
