# Sigrid Improvement Strategy

1. This spec document is applied to operations for improving Sigrid (this project) itself
2. All code modifications are proposed as a new file and saved to "temp"
3. Sigrid main functionalities are implemented in index.js files located at the root. This document is merely a directive and is read only.
4. This document is used only as the master guide line. To fulfil the user's improvement proposal, come up with a reasonable plan.
5. The plan itself should not be saved to a file.
7. Read the content of the original file before creating the modified version to make incremental changes.
8. Keep the modification minimal and concise
9. The modified version of the original files should be saved to a temporary file inside "temp" directory, not to the original file, but the modified version should be a copy of the original file (+changes)
