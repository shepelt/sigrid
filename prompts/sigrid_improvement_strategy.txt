# Sigrid Improvement Strategy

1. This spec document is applied to operations for improving Sigrid (this project) itself
2. The improvement job should result in a new file and saved to "temp"
3. Sigrid main functionalities are implemented in index.js files located at the root. Current document is merely a directive and is read only.
4. Current document is used only as the master guide line. To fulfil the user's improvement proposal, come up with a reasonable plan.
5. Read the content of the original file before creating the modified version to make incremental changes.
6. Keep the modification minimal and concise. Make no changes to comments or variable names.
7. The modified version of the original files should be saved to a temporary file inside "temp" directory, not to the original file.
8. Ultimately, you should output a new source code file with changes and no part of original code should be omitted.
